# Project: Stroke-Prediction-EDA-and-ML-Classification
## Supervised Learning
In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind to the strokes dataset to identify whether a patient has a stroke or not.  First, explore the data to learn how the stroke dataset is recorded. Next, I applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. Then evaluate several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterward, I made optimized the model that I selected and present it as My solution. Finally, Explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
### Starting the Project
This project contains three files:

- Stroke Prediction EDA and ML.ipynb: This is the main file where you will find the whole code
- stroke.csv: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
- Readme file: has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project.
